# To get a user ID, you can:
# 1. Ask the user to send a message to @userinfobot
# 2. Or use the bot's logs when a user sends a command
# 3. Or temporarily disable the whitelist to see user IDs in logs
# 
# To get a group chat ID:
# 1. Add the bot to the group
# 2. Send a command in the group
# 3. Check the bot logs - you'll see the chat_id (negative number)
# 4. Or use @userinfobot in the group to get the group ID
